	<p><center><h1>This project is broken down into 3 parts:</h1></center></p>
	<p><b>Step 1:</b> You will find labels, make drawings, or take photos of the following:</p>
	<p>A product containing <b>type 1 binary ionic compound </b>(one metals that forms one type of<br />
		action and one nonmetal - <u>NO POLYATOMIC ION)</u></p>
	<p>A product <s>contain</s> containing a <b>type 2 binary ionic compound </b>(one transition metal that<br /> you must specify the charge that forms with one nonmetal - <i>NO POLYATOMIC ION</i>)</p>
	<p>A product containing a <b>binary molecular compound</b> (only 2 elements, both of which<br /> are nonmentals)</p>
	<p>A product containing an <b>acid</b> (This will say "acid" in the ingredients list)</p>
	<p><b><mark>NOTE:</mark></b></p>
	<p>Your product may use slightly <u>different</u> naming rules. If you are unsure, check with me!<br />
		Make sure you use the standard naming system that we have learned in class when you<br />
		name the compound!</p>
